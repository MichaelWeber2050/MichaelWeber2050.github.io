Week 1 of bootcamp finished two days ago and yet I still find myself thinking of ways to 
manipulate the NYC MTA subway data from our first project. No sheep, I see pandas.count()
as I close my eyes. 

Since week 1 at Metis I have started to look at things a bit different. There's a little
voice in my head reminding me that there is data that can be synthesized and used to 
help explain and enhance the life around me. I used to "leave it to the experts" or write
off the responsibility for things like the power grid but now I have found that sometimes 
all it takes is a keen eye and determination to spark a significant change.

Learning is empowering and I'm excited to think of what lies ahead. 

After some climate talk at a memorial yesterday evening I find myself pondering the
following today:
* Taylor Wilson aka the youngest person to build a nuclear reactor and his plan for small
nuclear fission reactors 
you can hear him explain here - https://www.ted.com/talks/taylor_wilson_my_radical_plan_for_small_nuclear_fission_reactors?language=en

* Boyan Slat the Dutch inventor of a oceanic garbage cleanup machine and CEO of 
The Ocean Cleanup - I didn't know about the great pacific garbage patch until hearing 
him explain it a few years ago

* Quote I heard once - 
"As one person I cannot change the world, but I can change the world of one person"
a google search attributes this to one Paul Shane Spear and while I agree that each of
us can immediately impact those around us for the better even with a very small kindness,
and I strive to do this more and more in my life, I also have a revulsion to this quote
because if we think we can't, we won't. And then we succumb to insignificance.
